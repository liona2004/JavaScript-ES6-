When you export a variable or function, you can import it in another file and use it without having to rewrite the code


export const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}

ИЛИ

const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}

export { add };

export { add, subtract };




import { add } from './math_functions.js';
The ./ tells the import to look for the math_functions.js file in the same folder as the current file. 


 you have a file and you wish to import all of its contents into the current file
 import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
 The above import statement will create an object called myMathModule. This is just a variable name, you can name it anything.
 The object will contain all of the exports from math_functions.js in it
